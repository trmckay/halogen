Docs are written in markdown and contain useful information and notes (mostly for myself) regarding
the project.

All the docs are hosted at https://www.trmckay.com/rVr-kernel/.

[Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) is used to generate a static site for easy viewing, but
everything is still perfectly readable in its plaintext form. A `docker-compose` file is provided
for easily running the Neuron web app. Start it with `docker-compose up -d`.
