# Why Rust?

* Rust is a memory-safe systems programming language featuring ideas of ownership, borrowing, and
  lifetimes.

* It's safety features mean that buggy but semantically correct code that might compile in a
  language like C, is explicity disallowed by the Rust compiler.

* Things like buffer-overflows, memory leaks, and out-of-bounds accesses are very difficult if not
  outright impossible to do in Rust.

* All these features make me a lot less scared of managing a large project in Rust as opposed to C
  (the only other real alternative).

* But, most importantly: **I think Rust is fun and I get to choose the language**.
